  <br>
        Welcome to the "z2C: Zero to Cosmology" workshop, hosted by the PhD and PostDocs of <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/"><strong>CosmoStat</strong></a> and its collaborators on the April 9th and 10th. People in CosmoStat and its collaborators, come from diverse backgrounds—some steeped in theory, others grounded in observations, and still others bridging the gap between cosmology and computer science. Our collaborative efforts converge on unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, each of us approaching similar questions from unique perspectives. Our regular meetings, journal clubs, and learning sessions show that we use many different ways to improve our knowledge together and come up with new ideas.
        <br>
        Recognizing the value of our diverse expertise, we propose a "back-to-uni" style workshop: "z2C: Zero to Cosmology," scheduled for April 9th and 10th. This initiative is not about exhaustive coverage of cosmology or computer science. Instead, it's about offering a concise, comprehensive introduction to the key topics that frequently surface in our day-to-day work and discussions. By doing so, we aim to make it easier for everyone—regardless of their background—to follow along, participate more actively in discussions, and grasp the broader picture along with the specific advantages and limitations inherent to various approaches.
        <br>
        Tailored for master's students, PhD candidates, and postdoctoral researchers within CosmoStat and beyond, this workshop will blend presentations with hands-on sessions. Our goal is to ensure that participants not only understand the foundational theories but also how these theories are applied in practice, thereby fostering a deeper comprehension of our work's impact. Join us for an enlightening journey that promises to broaden your horizons and deepen your understanding of the cosmos as we explore it from every angle.

            <p>General Relativity was published by Einstein in 1915 and has completely changed our understanding of gravity. In this presentation, we will first introduce the ground principles of GR before giving an overview of the mathematical tools used to derive Einstein equations of General Relativity. We will finally conclude by discussing motivation behind beyong-GR theories of gravity and how the latter can be constructed.</p>

    <li>Introduction to Cosmology 
        <div class="description">
            Time: 10:00hrs - 11:45hrs with 15 min break in between<br>
            Contact person: <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/vilasini-tinnaneri-sreekanth"><strong>Vilasini</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/andreas-tersenov"><strong>Andreas</strong></a>
            <br>
            <p>In this presentation, we will embark on a journey through the universe's thermal history, exploring key milestones from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to the horizon problem, and the theory of cosmic inflation. We'll then delve into baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and the era of the dark ages, and reionization, leading up to the formation of cosmic structures. Through understanding gravitational instability and the Jeans length, we will examine the growth of perturbation modes across different epochs, culminating in an overview of the \( \Lambda \)CDM model and alternative cosmological frameworks. The presentation will conclude by addressing the current challenges and open questions in cosmology, offering a comprehensive yet concise exploration of the universe's evolution and structure.</p>

    <li>Bayesianism
        <div class="description">
        Time: 14:00hrs - 15:45hrs with 15 min break in between<br>
        Contact Person: <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/lisa-goh"><strong>Lisa Goh</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/andreas-tersenov"><strong>Andreas</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hsimonfroy/?locale=fr_FR"><strong>Hugo</strong></a>
        <br>
        <p>Bayesianism is a formal approach for building-up knowledge and making rational decision under uncertainty. One key application of Bayesianism is that given <em>a priori</em> information about the possible states of the world, one is able to propagate information from observed states to unobserved (latent) states, resulting into <em>a posteriori</em> information. This propagation process is known as inference.</p>
        <p>In a cosmological context, this translates typically into an a priori \( \Lambda \)CDM model, which links latent cosmology (\( \Omega \), \( H_0 \), etc.) to observations (galaxy, lensing, clusters, etc.). From given observations, one is then able to infer cosmology. After a theoretical introduction, we will present current methodology involving sampling methods based on Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) and variational methods based on Neural Networks (NN).</p>

        <br>
        <p>In the first session of our summary statistics course, we will introduce the concept of summary statistics, providing an intuitive understanding of its importance in data analysis. The discussion will then pivot to two-point statistics, laying the foundation for why and how we move beyond these traditional methods.</p>

    <li>Observables 
        <div class="description">
          Time: 10:00hrs-11:45hrs with 15 min break in between<br>
          <br>
          In this presentation the following observables will be covered: <br> <br>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Strong Lensing: </strong>
              <br> 
              Contact: <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/sacha-guerrini"><strong>Sacha</strong></a> 
              <br>
              This short presentation aims at describing the gravitational lensing effect with a focus on its strong regime. We will give the useful theoretical tools to understand this effects before discussing the potentiality of its probes to constrain cosmological parameters. If time allows, a notebook will be presented in which a full analysis of a strong lens is performed, first on simulations, and then on real data. 
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Galaxy Clustering: </strong> 
              <br> Contact: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-paviot-68853b260/?trk=people-guest_people_search-card&originalSubdomain=fr"><strong>Romain</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hsimonfroy/?locale=fr_FR"><strong>Hugo</strong></a> 
              <br>
              Galaxy clustering corresponds to a field of observational cosmology that aim to extract cosmological informations from the spatial distribution of galaxies. Indeed, the way galaxies agglomerate - the clustering - is driven by gravitational collapse (and thus the nature of gravity) and by the expansion of the Universe (and therefore the nature of Dark Energy). Looking at the spatial distribution of galaxies at different epochs is therefore a powerful tool to constrain the expansion rate of the Universe and the growth rate of structure. 
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Weak lensing: </strong>
              <br>
              Contact: <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/fabian-hervas-peters"><strong>Fabian</strong></a>
              <br>
              This short presentation aims at giving a brief introduction to weak lensing, starting from the historical overview of the main cosmological survey with a focus on systematics and give an overview on infering the data using 2 point correlation function.
            </li>
            <li> <strong> Clusters and voids: </strong>
              <br>
              Contact: <a href="https://www.cosmostat.org/people/lucie-baumont"><strong>Lucie</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-cerardi/?originalSubdomain=fr"><strong>Nicolas</strong></a>
              <br>
              Galaxy clusters, as the most massive collapsed objects in the Universe, occupy the nodes of the Cosmic Web. They are hence tracers of both the formation of structures and the history of expansion. We will describe the different components of galaxy clusters (dark matter, hot gas and galaxies) and present their observational aspects (in optical, Xrays and mm), with their advantages and inconvenients. We will finally review the main cosmological tests with galaxy clusters, develop their principle and the latest results.
            </li>
            <li> <strong> CMB</strong>
              <br>
